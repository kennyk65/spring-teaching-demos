This is a general example of an OAuth2 client.  This example is based largely on https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/spring-boot-oauth2 / https://github.com/spring-guides/tut-spring-boot-oauth2.

This is a standalone example using GitHub and Google as Authorization servers.  It does not add a resource server or homemade authorization server.
