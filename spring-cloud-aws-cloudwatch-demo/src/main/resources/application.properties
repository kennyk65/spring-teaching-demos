# Probably prefer to set this to true in production:
spring.thymeleaf.cache=false

# This setting keeps Spring Cloud AWS from trying (and failing) to identify
# the CloudFormation stack on which the deployment is running.  It does this 
# so you can inject things by their logical names in the template rather than 
# physical names.  Since it always makes the app blow up on BeanStalk, I'm 
# turning it off.
# See https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-aws/issues/50:
cloud.aws.stack.auto = false

# Automatically determine the region if running on AWS.
cloud.aws.region.auto=true
